	Originally in my program, I had a function that took in the row and column of a given cell and the colony Grid to check how many live neighbors the cell at the given (row, col). I was using one big if statement to check if any of the neighboring cells had an “X” in them. However, when I ran my program and ticked it forward a generation, the subsequent generation would always be full of dead cells. To start investigating, I put an extra line in my neighbor-checking function to see how many live neighbors each cell had. Every cell had only 0 or 1 neighbors, even if I could clearly see the cell had more neighbors. That’s when I realized that my if statement was the issue — it didn’t check all the neighbors. If one of the neighbors had an “X,” it didn’t check any of the other neighbors and simply made the live neighbor count 1. After realizing my mistake, I created a vector of the string (either “-“ or “X”) at each neighboring cell. Then I looped over the vector and increased the live neighbor count if the string was equal to “X,” thereby solving my issue.
