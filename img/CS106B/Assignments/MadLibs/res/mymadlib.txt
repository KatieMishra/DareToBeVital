So when I was three, I was this <adjective> little girl. So naturally everyone, including my parents, thought I was obsessed with <noun>. Like everyone thought I was already a <adjective> girl. To feed my “obsession,” my Mom hired <proper noun> to come to my birthday party. Fast forward to the day of my party. The doorbell rings. Excited little me runs over to open it, thinking it’ll be my friends. Instead, I SCREAM. Standing in front of me was this person pretending to be <person>, her face painted <color>, rosy cheeks, this whack <noun>, and a dress that was wayyy too short for her age.  I slammed the door close, ran down the stairs, and proceeded to sob behind our <noun> for the entire party. I didn’t even come out to get cake, it was that bad. Some things are just too much for a little girl’s <body part>.
