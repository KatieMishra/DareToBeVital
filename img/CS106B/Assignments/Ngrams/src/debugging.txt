In creating my map, I used a queue to store the n-grams. I was printing the map just to make sure it ran correctly, and noticed strange behavior. Each additional key added to the map would have one more word in it. So if I was trying to make a map of 2-grams, it would actually have one 2-gram, then a 3-gram, 4-gram, and so on. I added more print statements to the code so I could test when the length of the n-gram was being changed. Eventually I realized that the issue was my window, which I used to move over the text file and find the n-grams. For each move through the test, I was enqueuing a word to the window, but forgot to dequeue the first word. Therefore, my window was just getting longer and longer. I added a dequeue statement to fix my problem.
